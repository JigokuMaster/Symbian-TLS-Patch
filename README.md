TLS 1.2 patch for Symbian 9.x 

this repo contains:

* binaries for (S60v3, UIQ3,  x86 SDK Emulator),  built without PIPS/OpenC runtime.


* source-code of newtls-patch , forked from the original developer,  [shinovon - nnproject](https://github.com/shinovon/newtls)


* source-code of  MBedTLS for Symbian , also forked from [shinovon - nnproject](https://github.com/shinovon/mbedtls-symbian)

binaries can be downloaded from [bin](./bin) directory.

installation is done manually , the phone should be hacked , download ARM*.zip and just extract dll files to C:\\sys\\bin

note: i haven't tested ARM binaries for S60 yet.  they're not that different from shinovon's binaries (if you already have these).
